<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>An acquaintance is considering launching an e-commerce app targeting an underserved group of buyers and sellers. He approached me for consultation on how to proceed.</p>
<p>After a discussion about his proposed app, the target demographic, the competitive landscape, and his desired launch date, I recommended trying to define the feature set of the minimum viable product. It would be appropriate to begin work on mockups and prototypes once a rough feature set was established.</p>
<p>I created a mind map with necessary and potential features for his app and shared it with him as a first step toward defining the minimum viable product.</p>
