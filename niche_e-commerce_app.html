<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I am consulting for an acquaintance in the planning stages of an e-commerce project.</p>
<h2>Initial Guidance</h2>
<p>A nontechnical acquaintance is considering launching multivendor marketplace app targeting an underserved group of buyers and sellers. He approached me for a consultation on how to proceed.</p>
<p>After a discussion about his proposed app, the target demographic, the competitive landscape, and his desired launch date, I recommended trying to define the feature set of the minimum viable product. I created a mind map with necessary and potential features for his app and shared it with him as a first step toward defining the minimum viable product.</p>
<h2>Platforms &amp; Technologies</h2>
<p>The client asked me to research what technologies might be appropriate for the project and what qualifications and skills a cofounder might need to have. I surveyed platforms and technologies that could play a role in a multivendor marketplace app and classified what I found into four categories, ranging from hosted, template-based services to entirely custom products built from existing database, payment processing, and shipping solutions.</p>
<p>We discussed the benefits and drawbacks of varying levels of customization and agreed to focus on established services with moderate levels of customization and extensibility. I am currently preparing a brief on <a href="https://www.shopify.com">Shopify</a> with a <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/multi-vendor-marketplace">popular marketplace add-on</a> as a possible basis for the project.</p>
