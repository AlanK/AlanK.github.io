<h1>Citi FinTech</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I started as an iOS developer at Citi FinTech in May 2018. Due to a shortage of backend developers on my team, I have split my time 50/50 between iOS development in Swift and microservices development in Java since February 2019.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I work on the Insights team at Citi FinTech. On the iOS side, I add features and fix bugs on the Weekly Spending Summary, All Your Bills, and Monthly Overview dashboard tiles and associated screens. On the microservices side, I am responsible for the endpoint that generates those three dashboard tiles.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>I developed a miniature domain-specific language to make a powerful but complex Citi networking API easier to use</li>
<li>I have a reputation among the iOS developers as a thorough but fair code reviewer</li>
</ul>
