<h1>WeightWatchers</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I joined WeightWatchers as an iOS engineer in July 2019. Now I oversee two teams responsible for a handful of web apps.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I am responsible for our in-house CRM app, our customer-facing app for finding in-person and virtual workshops, and our internal system for creating and managing upcoming events.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked on the WW Mobile app, the company’s customer-facing iOS app. Before the pandemic, I worked on Studio app, an internal iPad app used to manage the customer experience at WW studio locations.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>During my tenure, the CRM app has gone from a notoriously failure-prone app with slow feature development to a reliable app with quick turnaround on new features.</li>
<li>I created complex behaviors by composing simple view controllers in custom container view controllers.</li>
<li>I worked with our designers to add visual flair to our app whenever possible, including using custom drawing and property animators where appropriate</li>
</ul>
