<h1>WeightWatchers</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I joined WeightWatchers as an iOS engineer in July 2019, was later tech lead for two teams responsible for a handful of web apps, and ended my tenure an iOS engineer again.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I worked on the WW Mobile app, the company’s customer-facing iOS app, as part of the Growth team.</p>
<p>Previously, I oversaw the CRM team, responsible for our in-house CRM web app, and the Workshop & Explore team, responsible for our customer-facing web app for finding in-person and virtual workshops and our internal system for creating and managing upcoming events.</p>
<p>Before that, I worked on the WW Mobile app as part of the Accounts and Content Hub teams. Before the pandemic, I worked on the Studio app, an internal iPad app used by coaches to manage the customer experience at WW studio locations.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>During my tenure, the CRM app went from a notoriously failure-prone app with slow feature development to a reliable app with quick turnaround on new features.</li>
<li>I created complex behaviors by composing simple view controllers in custom container view controllers.</li>
<li>I worked with our designers to add visual flair to our app whenever possible, including using custom drawing and property animators where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
