<h1>WW (formerly Weight Watchers)</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I joined WW as an iOS engineer in July 2019.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I work on the WW Mobile app, the company’s customer-facing iOS app. Before the pandemic I worked on Studio app, an internal iPad app used to manage the customer experience at WW studio locations.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>I create complex behaviors by composing simple view controllers in custom container view controllers.</li>
<li>I work with our designers to add visual flair to our app whenever possible, including using custom drawing and property animators where appropriate</li>
<li>I convinced our team to switch from manager PR reviews to peer-to-peer PR reviews to increase knowledge sharing and camaraderie</li>
</ul>
