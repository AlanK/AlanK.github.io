<h1>Metropolis</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I joined Metropolis as Senior iOS Engineer II and tech lead of the iOS team in May 2025.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>I am responsible three apps: the customer-facing Consumer app, the internal Valet app, and the internal Enforcement app. I provide technical guidance for two other engineers.</p>
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>An early project was fixing serious issues with the iOS test suite. Tests were configured to run on both GitHub and Xcode Cloud. However, most tests were not running on any platform. I revised our test plan to run all tests exclusively on Xcode Cloud, the cheaper and more reliable platform. Additionally, I spearheaded a major investment in new unit tests, including UI unit tests.</li>
<li>I also revised our code submission practices to improve code quality. I set requirements of maximum number of files changed per PR and maximum number of lines per file, encouraging developers to make small, focused changes.
