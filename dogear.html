<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>DogEar was an iOS utility app that made it easier to access your favorite or most-needed documents. It was built around security-scoped bookmarks to files in other applications’ iCloud Drive containers.</p>
<p>I have halted development on DogEar in light of the Files app included in iOS 11. Files and the related APIs appear to solve the problem DogEar was intended to address.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Central access to widely-dispersed documents</li>
<li>Allows fast QuickLook of bookmarked documents</li>
<li>Open bookmarked documents in their containing apps, using open-in-place where applicable</li>
<li>Bookmarked documents can be given custom display names and colors without modifying the underlying file name or attributes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting Bits</h2>
<p>Every table view cell in DogEar includes a <code>UIImageView</code> that may have its underlying image data change from time to time. I wanted each <code>UIImageView</code> to create an aspect ratio constraint based on its image data and return it for future use. I accomplished this with <a href="https://github.com/AlanK/DogEar/blob/master/DogEar/SystemExtensions.swift" title="See this code on Github">retroactive modeling on <code>UIImage</code> and <code>UIImageView</code>.</a></p>
