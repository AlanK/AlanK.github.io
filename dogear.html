<h1>DogEar</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>DogEar was an iOS utility app that made it easier to access your favorite or most-needed documents. It was built around security-scoped bookmarks to files in other applications’ iCloud Drive containers.</p>
<p>I have halted development on DogEar in light of the Files app included in iOS 11. Files and the related APIs appear to solve the problem DogEar was intended to address.</p>
<h2>Features &amp; Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Central access to widely-dispersed documents</li>
<li>Allows fast QuickLook of bookmarked documents</li>
<li>Open bookmarked documents in their containing apps, using open-in-place where applicable</li>
<li>Bookmarked documents can be given custom display names and colors without modifying the underlying file name or attributes.</li>
</ul>
